			Landscape includes natural and human landscapes. It is a kind of scene revealed by the reflection of light on objects. You say scenery or scenery, scenery and so on, meaning to a wide range. In ancient Chinese books, especially in poetry and prose of pure literary and artistic works, it has been used for a long time, even more scenery than love, almost in line with tourism. Like Jin Shu, there is a passage like this: "People crossing the Yangtze River, every spare time, want to go out to a new pavilion for dinner, Zhou Ying (Boren) sighed and said: the scenery is not different, there are differences between rivers and mountains." Li Bai also has the phrase "Drinking often for the scenery, the heroes are alienated from merit and fame". Others, such as Taibai, Mahao, Cui Hai, Du Zimei, Letian, Du Mu, Su Shi, Zhang Ji, and Xie Lingyun, the earlier landscape poets in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, are tourism experts who love landscape. As for the nature of the scenery, it is slightly different from the famous places.

			According to the landscape school Richthofen and G. O. Sauer, they all take Morphology of Landscape as the object of field observation, and also pay attention to the relationship between human activities (including psychological feelings) and the surrounding scenery. The essence of the scenery is endless. Even in different areas of different sizes, it has its own characteristics, that is, the image and color are very different. Its basic reasons are caused by long-term internal and external forces, meteorological changes, ecological frequency, location deviation, and human factors.

			The so-called Scenery, in essence, is a scenic spot that can arouse people's aesthetic appreciation and appreciation under certain conditions, composed of landscape scenery and some natural and human phenomena. Scenery, scenery and conditions are the three basic elements of landscape.
			Scenery is an objective factor and basic material of landscape composition. It is an individual of landscape material with independent appreciation value, including mountains, waters, plants, animals, air, light, architecture and other effective landscape materials such as sculpture, monuments and sites. Landscape sense is an active factor and subjective reflection of landscape composition, and it is the ability of human to perceive, identify and feel the scenery. For example, vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, association, psychology and so on.<br><br> Conditions are the restrictive factors and means of landscape composition, and are the special relationship between the main body of landscape appreciation and the object of landscape. It includes personal, time, place, culture, science and technology, economic and social conditions, etc.
